# Terma Foundry

**Open-source tools for Tibetan script on the modern web.**

We design and build the infrastructure Tibetan script needs in the digital world — a CSS framework, a curated font library, a traditional manuscript creator, and keyboard training tools. Everything built from the ground up. Everything free.

## The Tools

### ◈ termaUI — Tibetan CSS Framework
*Available now · Seeking funding for full production*

The world's first utility-first CSS framework built specifically for Tibetan script rendering. One stylesheet that solves every problem Tibetan developers hit when building for the web.

**What it solves:**
- Vowel marks and stacked consonants clipping out of their line boxes
- Browsers breaking text at every tsheg, splitting syllables mid-word
- No standard way to select fonts, set sizes, or handle Tibetan-specific spacing
- Reinventing pecha manuscript layout from scratch on every project

**Six utility modules:**

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Font Stacks** | `tr-jomolhari`, `tr-noto`, `tr-monlam`, `tr-drutsa` and 30+ more — one class selects font + fallback chain |
| **Guardian** | `tr-guard` fixes vowel clipping by setting the correct line-height, overflow, and spacing for any Tibetan element |
| **Typography** | `tr-text-sm` → `tr-text-5xl` — font sizes paired with Tibetan-optimized line heights |
| **Effects** | `tr-text-rainbow`, `tr-shimmer`, `tr-text-fire`, `tr-emboss`, `tr-glow-aurora` and more — composable visual effects |
| **Pecha Layout** | `tr-pecha`, `tr-pecha-dark`, `tr-pecha-title`, `tr-pecha-body`, `tr-pecha-folio`, `tr-yig-mgo` — traditional manuscript format in pure CSS |
| **Stacking** | Utilities for complex consonant stacks (3–4 deep) common in Sanskrit mantras and dharani |

**Works alongside Tailwind, Bootstrap, and any other CSS framework** — all classes use the `tr-` prefix with zero conflicts.

**Companion: terma.js** — JavaScript utilities for problems CSS alone can't fix: correct Tibetan line breaking, Unicode NFC normalization, and protection of double-shad and tsheg-before-shad punctuation.

```html
<!-- One line to start -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/termaui/dist/termaui.min.css">

<!-- Then compose classes on any element -->
<p class="tr-jomolhari tr-guard tr-text-xl" lang="bo">བཀྲ་ཤིས་བདེ་ལེགས།</p>
```

## Why This Exists

Six million Tibetan speakers. Fifteen centuries of literary tradition. A diaspora scattered across forty countries.

And fewer than a dozen usable digital typefaces — none designed for children, language learners, or the modern web. No CSS framework. No browser-based manuscript tools. Developers building Tibetan websites manually patch vowel clipping bugs, hand-write line-height hacks, and reinvent layout systems project by project.

We are building the infrastructure that should already exist.

## The Fonts We're Designing

Beyond the library of existing fonts, we are creating three original typefaces with master calligrapher **Jamyang Dorjee**:

**Terma Serif** — A refined scholarly serif for print and long-form reading. Consistent weight, precise hinting, full Unicode coverage. The font Tibetan publishing has needed for a generation.

**Terma Sans** — A clean screen-optimised sans-serif that works at every scale, from navigation labels to display headings, and sits naturally alongside Latin and CJK in multilingual layouts.

**Terma Lotsawa** — Simplified letterforms with generous spacing for children, heritage learners, and the diaspora. The font nobody has built yet — designed with educators who told us: *"I gave up because the writing looked too hard."*

## Tech Stack

The termafoundry.com website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), using termaUI itself for all Tibetan rendering. Deployed on Vercel. MIT licensed.

## License

MIT — free to use, modify, and distribute. All fonts retain their original licenses (SIL OFL unless noted).
